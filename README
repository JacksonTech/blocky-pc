Blocky is a journey that my 10 yr son and I have taken together where he can learn to program in JAVA and I can learn about 3D graphics.

The code in this repository uses OpenGL ES 2.0 and serves as a demonstration that it is possible to build a sandbox game like Minecraft that is able to run on the Raspberry Pi SBC.

Please join in and help us grow Blocky and make it better.
